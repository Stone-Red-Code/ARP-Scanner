<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when
publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment:
https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey
uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such
there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl,
mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring
tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by
distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter
enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only
    acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension,
    .template -->
    <!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s)
    if possible. -->

    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version?

    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's
    possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version
    number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <description>
      **Usage**

      1. Download the latest release
      - Chocolatey (Windows): `choco install arp-scanner --version=0.2.0`
      - Snapcraft (Linux): `snap install arp-scanner`\
      and `snap connect arp-scanner:network-control` to give it permission to send arp requests
      - GitHub (Windows/Linux): https://github.com/Stone-Red-Code/ARP-Scanner/releases
      1. Start `arp-scanner` with the IP range it should scan as parameter (e.g. `192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255`)

      &gt; Note: This programm may not work on all linux distributions because the [ArpLookup](https://github.com/georg-jung/ArpLookup) library has some [limitations](https://github.com/georg-jung/ArpLookup#supported-platforms)
